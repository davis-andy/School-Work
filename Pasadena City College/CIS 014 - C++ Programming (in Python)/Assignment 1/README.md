# Homework / Lab Assignments 1

## Homework 1
You are a banker and someone walks into a bank and gives you a stack of pennies --- hundreds of thousands of pennies, 
if you will --- and asks you to break them into the largest units of USD currency possible. Your customer also wants to 
know how much these pennies are worth in Canadian dollars.

For example, 123 pennies translates to 1 dollar, 2 dimes and 3 pennies. Additionally 123 US pennies correspond to 1.33 
Canadian dollars with today's exchange rate.

Your homework assignment is to write a simple console application that takes a user's numeric "pennies" input and 
returns a string output (using the USD units of currency).

### Example Console Output
<pre>
Please enter all of your pennies:
<b>8888</b>
In US currency you have: 88 dollars, 3 quarters, 1 dime, 0 nickels, and 3 pennies.
In Canadian currency you have: 118.210400 dollars.
