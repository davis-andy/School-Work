# Homework Assignments 6

## Homework 6.1
As you learned from this class there is no such thing as "circular array" since an array is a continuous block of 
memory. Its last index does not loop back to its beginning. For this problem you will simulate the effect of a 
circular array in that you'd be able to shift all of its elements to the RIGHT by M elements, where M is an 
integer >= 0.

<br />

Write the following function taking in an integer array (arr), its length (N), and the number of elements to 
right-shift (M):

<pre>
def rightShiftElements(arr: list, N: int, M: int):
</pre>

<br />

**Examples:**

input: [1,2], 2, 1

resulting arr: [2,1]

<br />

input: [1], 1, 0

resulting arr: [1]

<br />

input: [1], 1, 12

resulting arr: [1]

<br />

input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 6, 3

resulting arr: [4,5,6,1,2,3]

<br />

input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45], 45, 56

resulting arr: [35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]

<br />

**How to test (example):**

```
def main():
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
    size = len(arr)
    rightShiftElements(arr, size, 1)
    print('[', end='')
    for i in range(size):
        print(arr[i], end='')
        if i == size-1:
            print('', end='')
        else:
            print(',', end=' ')
    print(']')
```

<br />

**Constraints / Assumptions:**

* Your inputs come straight from main(...) **NOT** input(), etc., inside the above given function you have to write
* This problem tests your understanding of how array works in Python
* For this problem you will operate your solution directly on arr. **DO NOT create another array in 
rightShiftElements() for this problem.** This is the reason why rightShiftElements(...) is a void function. **NOTE:** 
recall array is passed into every function by "pointer", namely your function actually has a handle to where the 
original array is located. Any changes made to the array inside your function changes the original array outside of 
the function.
* Each right shift moves all of the elements to the right by one index, with the exception of the last element which 
moves into index 0
* The array is not empty, or N > 0
* The number of elements to right shift M >= 0
* There is nothing to print or return in the function, which should simply satisfy the logic requirement by shifting 
elements to right M times
* arr, when passed into the function, is decayed to a pointer that points to the first element of the array which 
means if you make modification to it in the function the original arr in main() will also change

## Homework 6.2 (Not sure how to word this in Python, but the concept is there)
std::vector (available via #include <vector>) is a template class and a C++ construct. Vector is a dynamic array 
that grows and shrinks dynamically as needed:

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/

To overcome integral size limitation (INT_MAX, DOUBLE_MAX, etc) we want to devise a programmatic scheme to store a 
number that can be VERY LARGE. To do that we have a positive number (N >= 0) whose digits are stored in a vector. For 
instance 123 is stored as [1, 2, 3] in the vector. 54321 is stored as [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] in the vector. 

<br />

Write the following function that simulates ++N by taking in its vector representation as the function parameter. The 
function returns the result of ++N in its vector form:

```
def plusPlusN(v: list) -> list:
```

**Examples:**

input: [1,2]

output: [1,3]

<br />

input: [0]

output: [1]

<br />

input: [1]

output: [2]

<br />

input: [9]

output: [1,0]

<br />

input: [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]

output: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

<br />

input: [9,2,3,9]

output: [9,2,4,0]

<br />

input: [9,9,9,9]

output: [1,0,0,0,0]

<br />

input: [2,9,9]

output: [3,0,0]

<br />

**Constraints / Assumptions:**

* This problem tests your understanding of how templated dynamic array (i.e., vector) works in C++
* Your inputs come straight from main(...) **NOT** cin, getline(...), etc., inside the above given function you have to 
write
* N >= 0; the input vector<int> v is **NOT** empty
* N can be very large, exceeding all integral limits in C++
* You may use any vector member functions (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) for this problem
* You may create your local copy of vector<int> as the value to return from the function. **OR** you may modify the 
vector<int> v that is passed-by-value into the function and return the modified v from the function. Either way it's 
completely up to you how you handle your return value
* Your main() function isn't graded; only the above referenced function is.
* Failure to follow the same exact function signature receives -1 logic point deduction
* You may have your test code in main(). The following is just an example using v = [9, 9]:

```
def main():
    v = [9, 9]
    retVal = plusPlusN(v)  # retVal = [1, 0, 0]
    print(retVal)
```
